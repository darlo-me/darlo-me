    I am Daryl. Chemistry graduate, software developer, network/systems admin, tech enthusiast, etc.

    This website is just a front for my email and DNS I use.
    
    I might, and probably will, use it to link to my projects or to random things I support.
    This may range from anything software related, to philosophy, music, etc.
